A4:
These results were not that surprising, because we evenly weighted the trigram, bigram, and unigram probabilities in the linear interpolation function. Had we used weighted probabilities, I would have expected linearscore() to perform better than scores(), but due to the even weightings the relatively poor performance of linearscore() isnâ€™t surprising.

Because our model was trained with the Brown dataset, it would make sense that data similar to that dataset would have a low perplexity. Therefore, it is likely that Sample1 is an excerpt of the Brown dataset, because the perplexity is very low (especially relative to the perplexity of Sample2).
