b) In the dependency graph of a projective sentence, there are no edges that cross over one another. Therefore, by checking to see that there are not any word-to-word edges that cross with another word-to-word edge, we can make sure that the sentence is projective.

c)
Projective: I watch television.
Non-Projective: I drove a bus this week which was white.
